Freedom Education: Provides resources to educate users on Bitcoin’s role in financial independence and resisting centralized control.

Open-Source: Fully open-source codebase to ensure transparency and community trust.

Decentralization: Leverages Bitcoin’s decentralized network and supports tools like Lightning Network for scalability.

Key Features

1. Self-Custodial Wallet

Mnemonic Seed Phrase: Generates a 12 or 24-word seed phrase for wallet recovery, stored securely on the user’s device.

Multi-Platform Support: Available on iOS, Android, and as a web app (running locally via WebAssembly for security).

Hardware Wallet Integration: Supports popular hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) for enhanced security.

Multi-Signature Option: Allows users to set up multi-sig wallets for added protection against theft or loss.

2. Privacy Tools

Tor Integration: Routes transactions through Tor for IP address anonymity.

CoinJoin Support: Facilitates CoinJoin transactions to obfuscate transaction history and enhance privacy.

No KYC: No requirement for personal information or identity verification, ensuring pseudonymous usage.

On-Chain Analytics Resistance: Implements techniques like avoiding address reuse and randomized change outputs.

3. Lightning Network Integration

Fast Transactions: Supports Lightning Network for near-instant, low-fee Bitcoin transactions.

Channel Management: User-friendly interface for opening, closing, and managing Lightning channels.

Decentralized Hubs: Encourages users to connect to community-run Lightning hubs to avoid centralized service providers.

Customizable Privacy Settings: Options to toggle privacy features (e.g., Tor, CoinJoin) based on user needs.

Localized Content: Supports multiple languages to make Bitcoin accessible globally.

Dark Mode: A nod to the cypherpunk aesthetic, with a sleek, privacy-conscious design.

6. Security Features

Encrypted Backups: Allows users to encrypt and store seed phrase backups on their preferred cloud service or offline storage.

Biometric Authentication: Supports fingerprint or face ID for quick, secure access.

Decoy Wallets: Option to create a secondary wallet with minimal funds for plausible deniability in coercive situations.

Regular Audits: Open-source code audited by the community and security experts.

7. Community and Governance

Decentralized Feedback: In-app feature for users to propose and vote on new features or improvements.

Open Development: Hosted on a public repository (e.g., GitHub) for community contributions and transparency.

No Corporate Control: Operates as a community-driven project, avoiding reliance on centralized entities.

Technical Stack

Frontend: React Native for mobile apps, React with WebAssembly for web app.

Backend: Minimal backend for Lightning hub discovery and CoinJoin coordination, running on decentralized servers or user nodes.

Bitcoin Protocol: Uses Bitcoin Core’s RPC interface for on-chain transactions and LND (Lightning Network Daemon) for Lightning support.

Privacy: Integrates Tor and CoinJoin libraries (e.g., Wasabi Wallet’s implementation).

Security: AES-256 encryption for local storage, secure enclave for key management on mobile devices.

Monetization

Freemium Model: Free to use with basic features; premium features (e.g., advanced privacy tools, priority support) available via a one-time Bitcoin payment or subscription.

Donations: Accepts Bitcoin donations to fund development and audits.

No Ads or Tracking: Adheres to privacy principles by avoiding ads and data collection.

Unique Selling Points

Freedom Narrative: Emphasizes Bitcoin’s role in resisting financial censorship and promoting individual sovereignty.

All-in-One Solution: Combines wallet functionality, privacy tools, and education in a single app.

Global Accessibility: Designed for users in both free and restrictive jurisdictions, with features to bypass censorship.

Roadmap

Phase 1 (Q1 2026): Launch MVP with basic wallet, Lightning support, and educational content.

Phase 2 (Q3 2026): Add CoinJoin, Tor integration, and hardware wallet support.

Phase 3 (Q1 2027): Implement multi-sig wallets, decoy wallets, and community governance features.

Phase 4 (Q3 2027): Expand to support additional privacy protocols and decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations.

Challenges and Mitigations

Regulatory Pressure: Mitigate by keeping the app open-source and serverless where possible, avoiding centralized points of failure.

User Education: Address complexity with intuitive design and comprehensive in-app resources.

Scalability: Leverage Lightning Network and optimize for low-resource devices to ensure accessibility.

Conclusion

LibertyVault aims to be more than a wallet—it’s a tool for financial empowerment, privacy, and education. By aligning with Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization and freedom, it seeks to onboard the next wave of users to a censorship-resistant financial system while providing robust tools for seasoned Bitcoiners.
